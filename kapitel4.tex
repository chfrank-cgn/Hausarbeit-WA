\subsection{Engagement Overview}


\subsection{Outlook}

Coming back to the original question for the paper "On which subject(s) should I post to increase my reach?" we now have a definite answer.

According to the data, posting more content on Climate Change and Covid-19 should lead to more visitors' engagement.

I'll keep that in mind for the future and change the content that I post accordingly.

Cross-posting to Facebook is an already established automated procedure, so I'll keep doing that for now. Also, I like posting in English, so I'll continue this practice as well.

I will work on the other two recommendations to improve Google search and mobile usability.
